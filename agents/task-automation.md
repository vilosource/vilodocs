# Task Automation Strategy

## Overview
Automated task execution system using Claude Code's Task agent to implement the panes feature systematically.

## Automation Approaches

### 1. Single Task Execution
Invoke the agent to complete one specific task at a time:

```
Please read docs/TASKS.md and agents/panes-developer.md. 
Find the next incomplete task and implement it following the TDD approach described.
Update TASKS.md when complete.
```

### 2. Batch Task Execution
Complete multiple related tasks in sequence:

```
Work through Phase 3 (Editor Grid Core) tasks in docs/TASKS.md.
Follow agents/panes-developer.md guidelines.
Complete tasks 3.1 through 3.4 sequentially.
```

### 3. Time-Boxed Sessions
Work for a specific duration:

```
Work on incomplete tasks from docs/TASKS.md for the next 30 minutes.
Follow TDD approach. Commit after each completed task.
Stop and report progress after time limit.
```

## Agent Invocation Template

```markdown
You are the panes-developer agent described in agents/panes-developer.md.

Your mission:
1. Read docs/TASKS.md to find the next incomplete task
2. Read docs/UI-SPEC.md for requirements
3. Implement the task using TDD:
   - Write failing tests first
   - Implement code to pass tests
   - Refactor if needed
4. Update TASKS.md status to ✅ when complete
5. Commit your work with descriptive message
6. Report what you accomplished

Current context:
- Working on feature/add-panes branch
- Shell and shared components are complete
- Next phase: Editor Grid implementation

Begin by identifying and implementing the next task.
```

## Task Prioritization Logic

### Priority Order:
1. **Blocking tasks** - Required by other tasks
2. **Core functionality** - Essential features
3. **Enhancements** - Improve existing features
4. **Polish** - UI/UX improvements
5. **Documentation** - Update docs

### Task Dependencies:
```
EditorGrid Core ──┬─> Split/Merge ──┬─> Drag & Drop
                  └─> Tab Management ┘
                  
Persistence ──────> State Recovery

Keyboard Shortcuts ──> Accessibility
```

## Progress Monitoring

### Success Metrics:
- Tests passing: `npm test`
- No TypeScript errors: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- No lint warnings: `npm run lint`
- Task marked complete in TASKS.md
- Git commit created

### Failure Recovery:
1. If tests fail → Debug and fix
2. If blocked → Document blocker in TASKS.md
3. If unclear → Check UI-SPEC.md
4. If dependency missing → Install or skip task

## Example Automation Session

### Starting the Agent:
```bash
# 1. Ensure on correct branch
git checkout feature/add-panes

# 2. Pull latest changes
git pull origin feature/add-panes

# 3. Check current status
npm test
npm run lint

# 4. Invoke agent (in Claude Code)
# Use the invocation template above
```

### Expected Agent Behavior:
1. Agent reads TASKS.md
2. Finds task 3.1 (EditorGrid state model) is next
3. Creates `tests/state/editorGrid.test.ts`
4. Writes comprehensive tests
5. Creates `src/state/editorGrid.ts`
6. Implements state model
7. Runs tests until passing
8. Updates TASKS.md (marks 3.1 as ✅)
9. Commits: "feat: implement EditorGrid state model with reducer"
10. Reports completion and moves to next task

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-task Checks:
```bash
# Ensure clean working directory
git status

# Run existing tests
npm test

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Post-task Validation:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Check test coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Verify no lint issues
npm run lint

# Run E2E tests if applicable
xvfb-run -a npm run test:e2e
```

## Task Batching Strategy

### Small Batches (Recommended):
- 1-3 related tasks per session
- Commit after each task
- Review and test between batches

### Phase Completion:
- Complete all tasks in a phase
- Comprehensive testing at phase end
- Integration testing before next phase

### Daily Goals:
- Morning: Core implementation tasks
- Afternoon: Testing and refactoring
- End of day: Documentation updates

## Quality Gates

Before marking any task complete:

### Code Quality:
- [ ] Follows project patterns
- [ ] TypeScript types complete
- [ ] No any types without justification
- [ ] Comments for complex logic

### Testing:
- [ ] Unit tests cover all functions
- [ ] Integration tests for components
- [ ] Edge cases tested
- [ ] Accessibility tested

### Documentation:
- [ ] TASKS.md updated
- [ ] Complex decisions documented
- [ ] API changes noted

## Optimization Tips

### For Faster Execution:
1. Keep test runs focused: `npm test -- specific-file`
2. Use watch mode during development: `npm test -- --watch`
3. Commit frequently to save progress
4. Skip E2E tests until feature complete

### For Better Quality:
1. Write tests first, always
2. Refactor after tests pass
3. Check accessibility early
4. Test keyboard navigation

## Emergency Procedures

### If Agent Gets Stuck:
1. Stop execution
2. Manually review the error
3. Fix or document the issue
4. Restart with updated context

### If Tests Won't Pass:
1. Isolate the failing test
2. Check test assumptions
3. Verify implementation matches spec
4. Consider simpler approach

### If Build Breaks:
1. Revert last commit if needed
2. Fix incrementally
3. Test each change
4. Commit working state ASAP
